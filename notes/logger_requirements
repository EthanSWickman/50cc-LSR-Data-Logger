Sensors:
- rpm
- accelerometer, speedometer 
- egt exhaust gas temperature  (control flow rate to keep this happy)
- coolant temp (control pump to keep in the right place)
- air fuel ratio (grab from existing 0-5V sensor, and keep happy by turning knob)
- rtc to synchronize clock

off-board sensors
- Weather sensor (John's buying) 
	- temperature
	- wind speed/direction
	- barometric pressure

actuators:
- coolant pump (takes 12v, adjust to keep engine temp at x)
- turn knob for air fuel ratio (adjust to keep afr at x)
- push shift lever with a button
- sd card to write to 
- light up lights using misc data



MVP: 
- acceleration/velocity
- egt/coolant temp
- rtc/sd card
